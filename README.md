# Decision_Tree_Classifier

- This model was created to observe how the given dataset performs using decision tree and whether it is appropriate to use this dataset in this model. The most optimum way for this dataset can be found by trying different parameters.
- After downloading the dataset in the repository to your computer and entering the relevant file path to the location specified in the code, the code will run without any problems.
- The model allows us to test it by changing many parameters. In this way, by trying different model scenarios, the necessary inferences can be made for each scenario.
- In jupyter notebook there are sample outputs of codes for a single scenario. You can also find additional explanations as text.
